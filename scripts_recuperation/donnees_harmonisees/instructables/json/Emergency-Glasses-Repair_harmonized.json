    "intro": "The first thing you learn about glasses, they break. If you are like me, and you have been using reading glasses for years, this is a problem you may have had several times. With reading glasses, you only wear them for reading, sewing, tying fishing knots, and other things close to your face. The rest of the time you have them in a glasses case of some kind in your pocket or purse. Then one day you take them out of their case while shopping so you can read your shopping list, and you find this. Yes, the temple hinge screw has come out and is lost forever. This is a five-minute repair, and the cure is as simple as a new screw. Assuming you can see well enough, you can buy a glasses repair kit at the pharmacy, sometimes. But what if the screw from the kit is the wrong size. You can go to the optometrist to get them repaired, but what if the optometrist office is closed. You are not at home so you can’t use parts from your old glasses, so what do you do? I found a trick that can get you past all these troubles.",

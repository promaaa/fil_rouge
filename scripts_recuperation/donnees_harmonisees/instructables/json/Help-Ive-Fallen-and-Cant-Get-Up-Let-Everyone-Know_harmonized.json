    "intro": "This project was inspired by a friend who lived alone and, due to a medical event, was left paralyzed in the middle of his kitchen for several days. He was unable to dial for help. By chance a neighbor barely heard his cries and called 911. If you are alone in your house, what do you do if you are incapacitated and can't call for help? I have a very simple, cheap solution. We see it all the time ...on top of police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances.... Why not place an EMERGENCY LIGHT on a part of the house that is highly visible to the public? Once activated, by one of an endless number of ways, passersby will recognize something is amiss and hopefully call the authorities. Here I will outline how to build a bare-bones system using an inexpensive timer to trigger the light. All this for under twenty-five bucks. For those so inclined, there are an endless number of ways to trigger the light using various inexpensive sensors....tailored to the needs of the houses occupants... voice activation or a simple panic button are a couple of examples that come to mind....just use your imagination.",

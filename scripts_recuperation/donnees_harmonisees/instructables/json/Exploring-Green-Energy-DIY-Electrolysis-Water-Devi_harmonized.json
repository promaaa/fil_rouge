    "intro": "Hello everyone, today I'm going to conduct a physical experiment on electrolyzing water. Electrolysis of water is the process of breaking water into oxygen and hydrogen gases. This is achieved by passing a direct current through water. Hydrogen gas is produced at the cathode (negative electrode), while oxygen gas is produced at the anode (positive electrode). Additionally, since water molecules consist of 2 parts hydrogen and 1 part oxygen, hydrogen and oxygen are generated in a 2:1 ratio. Furthermore, adding salt to water can accelerate the electrolysis process. I found several websites describing neodymium magnets, such as Wikipedia and TOPMAG (TOPMAG is the source for the diagrams. They're excellent resources for any kind of magnet you can imagine!). PS: If you find the guide I'm posting interesting, please click the \"Follow\" button above. Thank you!",

Therefore, the entire circuit forms a closed loop in saturated saltwater. When the battery switch is closed, the circuit is completed, and reactions occur. As a result, a large number of bubbles are observed on the Cu electrode, which is hydrogen gas. These bubbles drive the movement of the copper wire.</li><li>On the other hand, the Cu electrode is wound into a spiral coil. When the coil is energized, it acts like a magnet. At the bottom of the saturated saltwater, another magnet is placed. Two magnets with the same polarity repel each other, while those with opposite polarities attract.

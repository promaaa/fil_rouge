    "intro": "If you've ever wanted a smoother, easier, or even more \"futuristic\" way of exchanging contact information, then a digital business card may be for you. Here's the idea - your contact info is saved on a card, very much like a credit card. When you need to share that info, tap the card to another person's phone and your contact magically appears, giving them the option to simply save it to their device. It's quick, simple, and usually leaves an impression to boot. The idea isn't new, and a quick search will provide you with several companies where you can order them. But I prefer the DIY route so I can learn how things work along the way. So if you're interested in how to make one of these for yourself, read on! (Or if you're not interested but want to know out of spite, you can read on too)",

Step 1: Understanding How This All Works</strong><p><strong>Étapes :</strong></p><ol><li>I can't explain any technical details, but here's a quick overview: there's a chip embedded within the card, it's essentially a small amount of storage connected to some copper coiling. When it comes into close proximity with an NFC device, power is induced and the data contained in storage can be read. In this case, the data we will be storing, and then sharing, is our contact information.</li><li>And when it comes to sharing contact information, vCards are a solid and widely compatible choice. While it is possible to write the vCard data directly to the NFC chip, iOS does not currently support reading that type of data via NFC. So, in the interest of compatibility, we will be creating a vCard and hosting the file on a server, then writing a URL onto the NFC chip linking directly to that file.</li></ol>",

You then need to host this file on a server and get the URL.</li><li>The trick is for your URL to be a direct link. If you upload your file to a cloud service like Drive, Dropbox, etc and simply use their \"share\" link, the URL will direct to that service's own interface where you can view or save the vCard. But if you want that magic moment where the contact just appears on their phone, it has to be a direct URL, which essentially starts trying to download the vCard, and results with the \"add contact\" prompt automatically appearing on their device.</li><li>If you have your own way of hosting files, it might be best to upload your vCard there. If not, there are also ways to get direct links for files hosted in the cloud. I used Google Drive to host my vCard and used this site to get the direct link. I then used bit.ly to shorten it.</li><li>I know this can be done with other cloud platforms, too; if needed just search around for getting direct links on your preferred service.</li><li>I also came across a very nifty site (https://www.vcard.link) that will create and host vCards for you, if you would rather go with a simpler alternative. This gives you less control over certain things like custom labels, but circumvents the rigmarole explained above.</li><li>Before writing any data onto the card, I recommend designing and printing the card first - the more you handle the card, the more dirt and oils could be left behind, and it's best to print on as clean a surface as possible.</li></ol>",

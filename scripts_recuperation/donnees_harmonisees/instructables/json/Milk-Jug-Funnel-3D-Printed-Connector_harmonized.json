    "intro": "This is a very simple 'tool' or 'hack' to enable you to reuse Milk Jugs, for all sorts of things, by creating a 'funnel' from another Milk Jug. They are connected via a 3D Printed 'connector', which simply threads the two bottle screw profile together, avoiding spillage. It's not gonna change the world or anything, but I like the mindset behind the reuse of the bottle, and create a funnel by simple 'inversion' of another jug - cut to shape. I have been using it for the past couple of years, and it really is oddly satisfying. Milk Jugs after all are a really well designed thing, as they're cheap, ergonomic and durable. I've kept a range of bird/duck/squirrel foodstuffs (for my kiddo), as well as gardening things like Iron Phosphate for the lawn (after the paper box got damp - which actually inspired the whole thing). Although Milk Jugs are not 'air tight' 100% - I've kept excess Plaster of Paris, and also excess Cement in them (left over from when you buy a large paper bag of the stuff), and it's done well for a few months, meaning I didn't waste any. It's also been handy for unusual projects, such as making Gall Ink, as the 'galls' need to steep for weeks, and the process is kinda cross, so I'd not want to use a 'nice' container, as the smell would linger. Anyway, you get the idea. Hope it's useful. 3D print the part, which is for UK Milk, so does this work in the US? Dunno - perhaps adjust the CAD (scroll down for files), and upload if you have a better version for a given country! Thanks in advance.",

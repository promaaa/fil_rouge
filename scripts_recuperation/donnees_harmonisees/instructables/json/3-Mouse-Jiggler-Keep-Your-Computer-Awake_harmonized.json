    "intro": "Tired of your computer going to sleep while you are away? Is your company utilizing an application like Microsoft Teams that shows you as \"Away\" just because you haven't touched your mouse or keyboard over the past few minutes? Unable to install third-party applications to simulate key presses or mouse movement like Caffeine due to company policy? Well, do I have a solution for you -- and for under $3.00 (USD)! I was looking for a mechanical way to simulate mouse movement and came up with this cheap and easy solution. Let's get started! Update May 18, 2022: This project was originally conceived for my wife's work PC to prevent Microsoft Teams from showing her as being \"Away\" too soon. The laser mouse she had been using recently died. The replacement I gave her was an optical one (there is no red light emitting from the bottom sensor). The original device I made in this instrucable didn't work with the new mouse, so I tried just using a regular clock. I went to Walmart and found the Mainstays Basic Indoor 8.78\" Black Analog Round Modern Wall Clock for just $4.44! Now she is back in business and I didn't even have to add anything to it. The clock's second hand alone is enough to trip the new mouse and keep her PC awake. So consider giving that a go first. If it doesn't work, then print out the mouse pad pattern below and add it to the second hand. See the post from user \"sb37\" in the \"I Made This\" section for an example.",

You are talking on the phone with the tow service, working with both hands to see what might have gone wrong with your engine, in the dark. You remember the flashlight you keep in your pocket for times like this, but how can you use it? You don't have a third hand, and you can't hold it in your mouth. I experienced a situation very similar to that on a trip back from stargazing, and needless to say, it was not fun. If only I had a headlamp or some other way of securing the flashlight to my head, so I could see where I was working. That moment was the inspiration behind FlashClip, an easy way to convert a pocket flashlight into a head lamp, mounted on the brim of any-sized hat. In this Instructable, I will walk you through how I designed and built the first version of FlashClip, and how you can make one for yourself. Let's get started!",

I wanted to be able to easily slide the flashlight in and out of the clip for quick deployment, while not being too loose as to be insecure during use. I wanted it to be slim so it could fit in a pocket or center console, and not require any special parts or hardware. I decided it would clip into the front of the hat brim, so it would be aimed wherever the user was looking. I eventually settled on a two-plate sandwich design that gripped the flashlight during use and then stored it small for storage. Besides efficiency, the sandwich design allows for any size flashlight to be used, even longer ones that house multiple batteries.</li></ol>",

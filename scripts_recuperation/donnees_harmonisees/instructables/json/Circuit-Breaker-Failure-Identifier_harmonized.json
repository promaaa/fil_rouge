    "intro": "A long while ago a circuit breaker failure occurred at my friend's house and that caused a small fire in his room. After that, he replaced his breakers. But this time he wants to measure the temperature of all the main breakers in his house. So I told him to use his hand to sense the temperature. But he's afraid to do so. Then he asked me to do something very cheap to measure the temperature. So that's why I came up with this decision. You can follow this instructable to avoid such fire accidents caused by breaker failure.",

That will make the circuit breaker to heat up. If the temperature goes above 85` celcius, the hot glue will melt. So our sticks will fall down.

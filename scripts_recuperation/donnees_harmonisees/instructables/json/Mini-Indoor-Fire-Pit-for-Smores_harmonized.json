S'mores were introduced to my European-self via American movies and I never even thought to make them myself. That is until I met my newest friend, who happens to be a s'more obsessed American. Unfortunately, since he lives in an apartment in London, he's unable to make them himself and he's constantly trying to come up with alternatives. Believe me, there is nothing sadder than watching a grown man trying to heat up marshmallows with a lighter or spreading marshmallow fluff over saltine crackers and topping it with nutella. I finally took it upon myself to make him an indoor fire pit to satisfy his cravings.",

I know that it's not recommended to burn fire directly in a cement fire pit without any protection. At least that's how it's supposed to be done in large, outdoor fire pits. When exposed to direct, high heat, over time, cement can crack or even explode. Now, in theory, you won't be using this indoor fire pit for hours on end, so the possibility of the cement cracking is low, but... I read about the cement bowls exploding and now I can't put it out of my mind, so for safety, I recommend using a metal container that will fit within the bowl.</li><li>2. Have a metal or glass lid on hand, just in case you have to extinguish the fire. Don't leave the fire unattended and put it out even when walking out of the room for a moment. Especially if there is a possibility of a draft.</li><li>3. 1TBS of rubbing alcohol will burn between 3 and 5 minutes. Start the fire with small amounts of alcohol, just until you get an idea on how much to use and how long it will burn for.</li><li>4. EXTINGUISH THE FLAME BEFORE ADDING MORE ALCOHOL.</li></ol>",

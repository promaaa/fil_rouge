    "intro": "I have been doing some painting in a bedroom at my house. I wanted to pour paint into a roller tray, but I really dislike the way that the paint spills onto the sides of the can and fills the channel that the lid goes into. There's an inexpensive product that fits into the channel to make a neat pour spout (the one shown is from Home Depot), and I wanted to make something like that.",

I am leaving all of that plastic so the pour spout will retain its shape. The container's plastic sides are thin, and I'm afraid that they will unexpectedly bend during pouring.</li><li>Also cut out a drain hole at the bottom of the container. No real rules about the size. I think that the size shown here turned out to be a bit small. But that all depends on where you intend to pour your paint.</li><li>Caution: Be careful not to cut yourself. A knife can take an unexpected turn while cutting the curved plastic.</li></ol>",

You can quickly make a simple one with cheap and available parts. This one came to be, when we needed playground markers for our scouts group game. We needed gentle light source not to spoil the night game atmosphere, but strong enough to clearly mark the perimeter. I was surprised how well they come out and the kids were enthusiastic about them. There are two main \"OH\" factors here: This can't be used in (quick) motion, as it is only a tiny magnet which is holding the clip in place. For such uses fix the clip some other way. What is extra suitable here is you need no tools to make it. There is no switch in this design (nd adding it would complicate things), so you make - and break - this beacon every time you use it. It is quick and simple enough. If you want extra effects, you can use a blinking LED (I gut some of those blinking candles to get them) Picture of the finished project doesn't do it justice, it gives away nice coloured light, not a white one as in the picture. <ul><li>to use a binder clip to provide a contact LED - cell</li><li>to use a disposable packaging for light diffusion</li></ul>",

In worst case they can be ordered via web for a penny. LED is a \"standard\" one - if it is not, it may drain the battery too quick or even not light at all. Here I use a RGB LED, which is practical, because this way you can always have three colours at hand. (Just to let you know - making more colours to light up inside is a bit complicated, because electronics (different colours have different Vf ...)</li><li>3V button cell - a standard button cell battery; even a quite spent one may work for hours</li><li>small magnet - I get them from old disk player heads or HD linear motors. You can probably use an ordinary fridge magnet, just that it's not too big.</li><li>small piece of paper - used just to prevent short circuiting the battery</li><li>semi transparent white container from thin plastic - I used a disposable one from white cheese, which I have in excess. Plastic has to be thin enough that the magnet \"grips\" the clip through. Plus, the material has to be just the right transparence to let the light through, but to diffuse it. You may have to experiment here to get the right box, but I guess everywhere in the world there is a lot of them.</li><li>sticky tape - for better portability you can put it over the magnet not to loose it.</li><li>Some parts here will surely be somewhere in your home, some not so much - but are still extremely cheap and readily available:</li><li>Instructions here are for a single light.</li><li>(binder and magnet on paper in the picture so that they are visible well on dark underground; magnet is the brown circular thingie)</li></ul>"

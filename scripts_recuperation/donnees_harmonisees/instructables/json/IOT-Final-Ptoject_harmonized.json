    "intro": "Final Project Video A person's room/ home is his natural environment, where he can feel safe and free to be himself. For people with ADHD, it can be very difficult to remember things, and they often forget to do some basic tasks such as leaving the lights and AC on when they leave the room. We wanted to create a system that enabled those people to be the best versions of themselves. Our system supports the following scenarios: 1. Turning off lights after leaving a room. 2. After leaving a room, switch off the fan. 3. The Blynk app lets users turn on and off their lights from the app, and it can be done while in a room as well, creating an elegant smart home experience. 4. The moment we leave the room and slam the door, a notification will be sent to the app that the lights are on, so we can turn them off again even if we did not notice. 5. In the event that the temperature sensor detects a temperature higher than the average temperature in the room, a notification will be sent to the application explaining to the user that the temperature is higher than normal, and whether he wants to turn on the fan.",

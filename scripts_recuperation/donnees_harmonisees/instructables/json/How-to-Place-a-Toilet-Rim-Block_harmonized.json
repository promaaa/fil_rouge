Instead of hanging it with the hook over the edge of the toilet, push the hook under the edge of the toilet. Done!</li><li>The toilet rim block sticks much better and you no longer suffer from the hook that hangs over the edge, attracts dirt and gets in the way of cleaning! As you can see in the video, it sticks perfectly this way!</li><li>I do recommend using gloves when removing. You did this in the traditional way, of course, but I wanted to give the tip anyway!</li><li>Have fun with this life hack and see you soon!</li></ol>",

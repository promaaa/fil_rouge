    "intro": "Hey :) We are two CS students from IDC Herzliya, Israel. As students, with the help of the academia, we want to help with research and learning for populations that are close to us and need help. We interviewed two blind, elderly people. We asked to know what difficulties they are experiencing during their daily routine and what problems they think we should try to solve, within our capabilities. This is how we came up with the idea of our project. Fortunately, we participated in an IoT course, led by Zvika Markfeld from the ForReal Team, and we gained the necessary tools in order to try to help others. As you can see in the video above, the device is set to help with 5 different daily-routine scenarios: Do you know a blind person? Try to build a similar device! We will guide you through the construction of our work. Please notice: We chose to focus on events that were important to our interviewees and ones that we thought we could resolve. Of course, the device is not suitable for everyone and there are those who might think that one should try to handle other events, for whatever reason. if that's how you feel, we urge you to contact us so that we can help you solve any problem, in the above field, with the help of the knowledge and experience we have acquired. <ul><li>Dog feces (poop) detection device - When walking in public, it is often difficult for the blind to identify the location of their assistance dog feces.</li><li>Send Email to an expert at a relevant association, with a click of a button - Engaging with a professional, in any field, can be a challenging action for a blind person.</li><li>Post to a Facebook group of volunteers (+optional requests follow), with a click of a button - Communicating with volunteers can be challenging, so it's important to make the social networking capabilities accessible to blind people. If the creator of the device wants, he is able to track the number of requests of each user, using a dedicated Google sheet, and identify requests and exceptional quantities.</li><li>Get \"Time to take medicine\" notifications from Google calendar - Taking medication can be a challenging action if you do not receive appropriate alerts. With the help of our device, a blind person can be assisted by a volunteer who will enter the medication taking events in a dedicated Google calendar on his smartphone device and our device will alert the blind at the right times.</li><li>Get weather notifications every morning - Most often, the blind are unaware of the sight of the sky so it is important to be updated on the weather, without the need for unnecessary actions.</li></ul>",

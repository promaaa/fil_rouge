    "intro": "I purchased a floor model air conditioner several years ago to cool my living room during the hot summer days. All was good until I wanted to automate the ON/OFF switch with some kind of Wi-Fi pushbutton device that would start the A/C automatically, on some kind of schedule, before I got home from work to arrive to a cool room. I bought a Wi-Fi pushbutton device that promised to do just that. Except that the model of air conditioner I have has a special type of ON/OFF switch that only responds to a finger push and not to a robot of any kind (for some reason?). So basically, the device was worthless for this purpose until I considered that the remote control for the air conditioner had a regular ON/OFF button that could be made to work with the pushbutton robot. And thus, I set off to build an apparatus to hold the bot onto the remote control so that it could push the ON/OFF switch on a scheduled routine at least several times a day. And it worked after much testing.",

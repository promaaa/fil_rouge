    "intro": "Optimication of Water Boiler combined with fossil fuel Heating system, using Smart Home components Shelly 1, Shelly Addon, Thermosensors, Rasperry Pi, Homeassistant If you do not want to heat your Water hoter than your system did, you also can configure the system to reload the hot water if the hot water temp is faster sinking than your boiler temperature. (Depending on your water quality further heating in permanent cycles are not a good idea because of calcium \"fallout\" in the heating system) Or you can by \"manipulating\" the sensor value of your boiler water, switch your boiler system faster off, to not allow the system to produce not needed heat. If you do that make sure you only manipulate the sensor to a higher temperatur to keep the security of your system intact ! There is also (with additional temp sensors and Shelly Relais) the possibility to clever manage your hot water cycling pipe pump (these is the pump which supply far away water outlets with hot water so you do not need to run cold water out first to get hot water later). If you have such a system you have to take care that the cycling is running long enougth to get not standing water, and on the other side do not waste energy by pumping permanent and losing heat throught the pipe system. Also a hot water flushing of the system could be good for reducing bacteria population in the pipe. So that probably will be my next projects.",

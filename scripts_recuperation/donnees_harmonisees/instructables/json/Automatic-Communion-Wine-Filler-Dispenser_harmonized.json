This will save a lot of time for churches that have a lot of members or do communion every week. My friend came to me with a need, his church has a prep guy for their communion that wishes it didn't take so much time to fill all the cups, because although he enjoys prepping for The Lord's Supper, he wishes he could get it done faster to serve the church in other ways as well. This device was designed to fill that need. There are other communion tray fillers that do a better job than this one. The main drawback to this filler design is that not every cup is filled perfectly evenly, so there is an additional step at the end that involves using a syringe to even out the level of grape juice in each cup.

The hole size was determined after much trial and error.</li><li>I've attached a paper template for you to use. You simply glue or tape it on the back of the pizza pan.</li><li>When you've cut the template out and attached it to your pizza pan, use the center punch on the center of each hole to guide your drill bit when you drill the hole. I was afraid of denting the pan, so I cut with a jigsaw a circular piece of wood for the pizza pan to go over, and screwed it together with deck screws. Make sure that the side with the screw head is facing down so that your drill bit doesn't hit the screws in the wood.</li><li>Once your holes are punched, drill them out. I found that you need to start small and work your way up. If you immediately drill to the final hole size, they won't be perfectly round and you will end up with cups that are overflowing, while other cups don't fill at all.</li><li>I started with a 0.07\" drill bit, because it was the smallest size that would fit in my drill chuck. Once the 0.07\" size is drilled, I don't use the wood piece underneath the pan anymore, trying not to push too hard on it as I'm drilling.</li><li>Then I drilled to 0.081\".</li><li>Then I drilled to 0.086\"</li><li>Then I drilled to 0.093\"</li><li>Then I drilled to 0.101\"</li><li>The reasoning for deburring so often while drilling is that I wanted to keep the burr sizes small and manageable so that I could be less intrusive when doing the final deburr, so as to not affect the hole shape. It's possible that you can skip some of this deburring (since it is a 30min-1hour ordeal each time). But I wanted to give you instructions that I was sure would work, and I feel confident in these instructions.<ul><li>Because the Pizza Pan is 10\" in diameter, your standard 8.5 x 11\" sheet of paper is too small to fit the whole template on. The easiest way is to print a template on an 11x17 sheet of paper, but I know that not everybody has access to that. So I've included two types of templates. One is for 11x17 paper, and the other templates are for 8.5x11. If you use the 8.5x11, you will need to cut the template from two pieces, then tape it together.</li><li>When you print the template, make sure your print settings are correct. Most printers default to \"Fit to page size\" You need to set it so that your Print Scale is either turned off or the Scaling is 100%.</li><li>As you're drilling, try to drill as straight as possible. Try to mind your hole depth as you're drilling. Once you're through, don't go any deeper. We want each hole to be as nice and uniform as possible.</li><li>As you're drilling, you may find that the pan wants to run up the drill bit. You should avoid this if possible. Either hold it down or find a way to keep it held down.</li><li>After this I deburred it with the mini triangular scraper. A note about deburring, try to be gentle so you don't mess with your hole shape. I like to run the scraper around the edge of the hole at an angle (gently cutting the burr), then trying to knock it loose holding the scraper straight up in the hole while spinning it in my fingers. I've attached pictures so you can see what I'm talking about. Sometimes I used my fingernails to help knock a burr off. I have pretty thick fingernails though, not sure if that would work with everybody.</li><li>The good news about stepping up the drill bit size like this is that after you deburr the first time, the holes don't seem to get burrs as bad as that first time. So deburring will be easier in the future.</li><li>I deburred it again here</li><li>Deburr a final time.</li></ul></li></ol>",

Mark it with a marker. Do this for all 4 edges. Then you can line up the edge of the pan with the marks you made on the plate. Look at the images to get a better idea of what I'm talking about and for the dimensions you need. I used calipers (see image) to measure it, because the dimensions are atypical.</li><li>Once you've got the pan lined up with your marks, get your marker and draw around the pan to mark out the hole you need to cut in the plate.</li><li>Now you're ready to cut out with a jigsaw. Be mindful when you're cutting so that you don't bend the plate. If the plate gets permanently bent, the tray filler will never work right because it has to be level to work. I cut out four \"pizza slices\" (see image) because I thought it might help prevent bending of the plate, but after I cut it, I didn't think that was necessary. I drilled a hole with a hole saw near the edge and then used that hole to start my cut.</li><li>Also, remember that cutting fluid will wash away permanent marker. It's possible to cut without cutting fluid, but you may go through jigsaw blades more quickly.</li><li>When you're done, deburr it so that nobody cuts themselves.<ul><li>Try to be mindful about how you have the marker angled when you are drawing the mark. You don't want your hole size to be too small (the pan won't go in) or too big (the pan moves around too much in the hole). You may want to put something heavy on the pizza pan so that it doesn't move around while you're marking it.</li><li>Be mindful about where on the line you want the jigsaw blade to cut. The outer portion? The inner portion? You want to guarantee the pizza pan will fit without having too much end play when you're done. (Although a little is OK)</li></ul></li></ol>",

I like to run all the nuts up over a bolt (see image) and wear it off with a wire wheel. Do this at your own risk :) Try to orient the rotation of the wire wheel in relation to everything so that it runs the nuts further onto the bolt rather than off of the bolt.</li><li>2) If you don't know how to hold the nut over the hole, I like to use a bolt, the nut to be welded, and an additional nut to hold everything in place. (see image) This way you can guarantee that the bolt will line up with the hole and keeps the nut from moving when you're welding.</li><li>Then weld it up!</li><li>I spray painted after this step. Try to find some way to keep paint from going into the nuts, otherwise it will be more difficult to turn the bolts when you're done.<ul><li>As mentioned earlier, if welding is out of the question, you can probably tap a hole instead, but you should use thicker angle iron (and therefore longer bolts to attach the angle iron to everything).</li><li>That's why I added a 5th 1/2\" nut and bolt to the list of materials, because you need an additional nut to do this. The extra bolt is because the heat from welding will burn away the coating on the bolt. So I like to use the same bolt for every hole I weld, then toss it for fresh bolts once everything is welded.</li><li>I like to run some old bolts up through the nuts to protect their threads, then paint them.</li><li>I like to use different bolts than the ones that will be on the final product, so that I don't get paint on them.</li></ul></li></ol>",

The cup on the end of that row is called the \"master cup\". That is how you line everything up. Draw a line that's in-line with your \"master cup\" on your pizza pan, and draw a line in the dead center of your top plate (see image).</li><li>Set the dispenser on a table where you intend to use it. Use a level and the leveling screws you built to make sure everything is level.</li><li>Put your communion tray underneath the dispenser. The side and back pieces will ensure that everything is lined up. Make sure that the \"master cup\" lines up with the lines you drew on the top piece and the Pizza Pan filler.</li><li>Pour your communion wine into a measuring pitcher. I have found that 12 ounces works perfect for me.</li><li>I've found that your pouring method into the dispenser matters. So take the 12 ounces that you've poured into the measuring pitcher, and put it into two separate cups, 6 ounces in each.</li><li>Pour the communion wine from the two cups into opposite ends at the same time. See image. Do it as fast as you can without splashing communion wine out of the filler.</li><li>Once all the cups fill up, you will notice that communion wine is no longer pouring in, but is slowly dripping in. At this point, you could take the tray out; however, it is likely that some will drip onto your tray and make a mess. To prevent this, take a towel and wipe the remaining communion wine out of your pizza pan filler.</li><li>Now you can pull the tray out.</li><li>The book of Proverbs says, \"we may roll the dice, but the LORD determines how they fall.\" I say, 'we may pour the communion wine, but the LORD determines how it falls\". You may need to make adjustments to ensure it is all level. So take your food-grade syringe, and suck some out of the cups that have too much and put them in the cups that don't have enough. Get everything even. If you're worried about some dripping out of the syringe while you're transferring the liquid, you can slowly pull up on the plunger as you're transferring it. That way, none drips out.</li><li>That's it... you're done!!!</li></ol>",

Umbrellas do a good job shielding your head and upper body, but your legs often get soaked, and worst of all, they occupy one of your hands. Raincoats tend to feel stuffy, and as they usually don't cover your face, you often end up getting cold and wet anyways. What if we could combine the two ideas, creating rain gear that provides great ventilation while not taking up your hands?",

I realized that if the scarf were extended long enough, it could also provide protection from the rain. That insight led me to seek out a wide-brimmed hat that could serve as a functional rain shield.</li><li>That’s when I discovered the “umbrella hat”—a wearable version of a traditional umbrella, with a folding mechanism controlled from the top rather than along a handle. This hands-free, wide-brimmed umbrella hat became the foundation of the design.</li><li>To create a full-coverage rainwear system, the upper portion of a waterproof jacket is attached to the umbrella hat. Its length can be adjusted to ensure a good fit for people of different heights.</li><li>For ventilation, the gear includes two sets of mesh-covered openings: one under the arms and another near the waist, helping to promote airflow and reduce stuffiness. The bottom portion features an elastic band that fits snugly around the waist, making the length adaptable and keeping water from splashing in underneath.</li></ol>",

To leave room for overlap and closure, we’ll round it down slightly to 170 cm. This gives us a target circle with a radius of approximately 27 cm (since 170 ÷ 2 ÷ 3.14 ≈ 27 cm).</li><li>Next, cut Velcro strips into 1-inch pieces. Evenly space and attach them around the inside rim of the umbrella hat, forming a circular pattern.</li><li>Take the longer section of the shower liner (the one without the built-in weights) and attach its top edge to the Velcro on the umbrella hat as shown.</li><li>Note: You only need one set of Velcro pieces attached directly to the umbrella hat. However, you may want to add a few extra Velcro points to the upper part of the rain gear itself as shown. This allows you to adjust the height as needed to ensure the arm openings align comfortably for different body sizes.</li><li>Use Velcro strips as “buttons” to create a front closure for the rain gear. Be sure to leave an open space around the face for visibility and comfort.</li></ol>",

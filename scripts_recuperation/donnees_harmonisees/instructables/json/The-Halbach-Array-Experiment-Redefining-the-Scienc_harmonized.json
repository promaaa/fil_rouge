    "intro": "I need a small but super-strong magnet. We have a magnetic knife rack, typically using a few small neodymium magnets to enhance magnetism. However, when adding more knives, conventional magnets may not provide enough strength to support their weight. This guide comes to the rescue, demonstrating a small experiment to create a reinforced powerful magnet. I took 5 cubes (2mm x 2mm x 2mm) of neodymium magnets and arranged them in various configurations to visually experience the magnetic force of the Halbach array. In method one, all the north poles are aligned to the left. (Note: The arrows in the diagram point to the north pole of the magnets.) Method two displays the specific arrangement of magnetic poles known as the Halbach array. The Halbach array provides a significantly stronger magnetic field on one side and a much weaker field on the other, arranged as north right, north up, north left, north down, north right. In method three, two different arrangements of the Halbach array are compared to test if their performances differ. The magnets are arranged in a pattern with alternating north pole directions; north left, north up, north right, north down, north left. In method four, the magnets are arranged in a pattern with alternating north pole directions; north up, north down, north up, and so on. I found a couple of websites that describe the Halbach array, such as Wikipedia and TOPMAG (TOPMAG is the source of the charts. They are an excellent resource for any magnet you can imagine!).

This demonstrates that the magnetic field strength above each small magnet is different. Some specific arrangements enhance the magnetic field strength in a particular direction of the small magnet. This unique structure is known as a Halbach array, where the magnetization directions of individual magnets rotate at specific angles in the array, producing the strongest magnetic field with the minimum number of magnets. Magnetic field lines concentrate above the small magnets, reaching their maximum strength, while below, the magnetic field lines are sparse, forming an approximate sinusoidal distribution in space</li></ol>",

    "intro": "Google Cardboard Camera is a fantastic app that captures 3D panoramas and records audio during capture. Viewing these 3D images requires some kind of phone-based VR headset; nominally a Google Cardboard. The Cardboard includes lenses, a slot for the phone, and a clever way for the user to tap the screen while wearing the headset. It does not have a strap though, so extended use is uncomfortable. Actually, being that it's made of cardboard, it isn't very comfortable for any length of time. Google Daydream is a phone-based VR headset that does have a strap, and includes a wireless remote that can connect to the user's phone. Inexplicably, this Google headset and Google remote are not compatible with the Google Cardboard app. The Daydream can be used to view images, but cannot be used to navigate through the gallery, even though navigation requires one and only one input: tapping the screen.

This \"button\" is covered in metallic mesh and is part of a lever whose other end is also covered in metallic mesh, and is electrically connected to the \"button.\"</li><li>Pressing the \"button\" causes the other end of the lever to press against the phone screen. The touch screen of a modern phone measures the change in capacitance that occurs when your finger presses against it. By electrically connecting the lever to your body through the metallic mesh, you can tap the screen through the button.</li><li>I tried recreating this mechanism on the Daydream using a small metal rod, some wire, and a piece of conductive foam. The rod was mounted to the inside of the Daydream using a 3D Printer Pen and a hole was drilled into the top so a piece of wire could stick out as the \"button.\" This didn't work! So I removed it and moved on. It should have worked though, and the next step will explain why it didn't.</li><li>(This is a valid option, but step 3 of this Instructable is a simpler alternative)</li></ol>",

Two of these are black and are conductive; they're likely made from a rubber mixture containing graphite. Behind the two nubs you'll find metal. This metal seems to provide enough capacitance to convince your phone that the rubber nubs touching it are fingers touching the screen. Unfortunately, if a finger is already touching the screen, the Cardboard Viewer won't let you tap.</li><li>Remove these nubs using pliers, then replace them with felt (or non-conductive rubber) pads.</li></ol>",

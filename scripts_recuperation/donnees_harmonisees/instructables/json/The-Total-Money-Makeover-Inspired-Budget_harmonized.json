    "intro": "This Instructable is inspired by the bestselling book, TheTotal Money Makeover, by financial coach Dave Ramsey. I am not affiliated with Ramsey Solutions; I just want to share the amazing tool Every Dollar with everyone. My budget is my new best friend. It is so freeing to have a proactive plan for each paycheck, and Every Dollar makes it simple and fun to do that. There is a premium version of the app, which connects to the user's bank account and helps to sort transactions. But I prefer to stick with the free version, as it is easy enough to record transactions manually. This post will break down how to get and use the app for first time users. Happy budgeting!",

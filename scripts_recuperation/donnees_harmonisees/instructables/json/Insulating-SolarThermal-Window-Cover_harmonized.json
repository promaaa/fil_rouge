    "intro": "Do you have a room or rooms that are cold in the winter no matter how much the heater runs? Do they stay warm for about 20 minutes and then the temperature drops to around 55F? Other than check for and seal drafts and leaks around windows and doors you could open the blinds and curtains and let the sun shine in and heat the room for you. But the purpose of the curtains is to help keep the heat in and maintain privacy of the room. As well as that some heat just shines right back out of the room through the same window almost as much as it increases the room's temperature. Of course you could run the house or aparment heating system to make up for the cold room but that would eventually be expensive and bad for the environment. Well, I had a problem like this and thought about a solution. One was a outside solar/thermal heat box ported to the window to heat the room due to a sunny window. Second was to use a solar vacuum tube thermal box that would probably be the solution to this problem without any effluent to the atmosphere. Problem was that both were rather difficult to build and setup for a regular person and that they were entirely outside the room in the cold. So I began to study the temperature in the room with a non-contact thermometer to see how cold it was so that I could determine if the heater I was about to install did indeed heat the room for at least a 5 degree increase. This Solar/Thermal Window Cover is so simple a regular person can build it with just a few tools in about twenty minutes. And best off all it stays inside the room between the window shade or blinds and the window glass. And the curtains can stay closed to help insulate the room and keep the heat in. Basically, this Solar/Thermal Window Cover is nothing more that some box cardboard slightly smaller that the window and that has been painted black on one side. This black side faces out towards the sun. The sun shines on the black Solar/Thermal Window Cover and it gets hot. The hot air flows upwards towards the top and exits at the top curtain rod assembly. Then cooler air is drawn from below and the cycle repeats continuously all day and cloudy days too. You will definitely notice a warmer room in no time and if you keep the door closed you may not have to turn on the central heat to heat that room during the day, thus saving money, fuel and the atmosphere. I'll never cease to wonder why I had not learned about this before as some standard knowledge so it is up to me to share it with you.",

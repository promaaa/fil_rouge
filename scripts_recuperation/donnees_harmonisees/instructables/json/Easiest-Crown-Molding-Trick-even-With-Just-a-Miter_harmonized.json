    "intro": "Do you struggle to understand the fundamentals of cutting the perfect crown molding corners (inside or outside)? Have you watched instructional video after instructional video trying to learn coping (or getting discouraged because of so many different tactics to try) just to wind up either more confused or buying expensive tools that will supposedly make your life easier? Or maybe you simply only have a basic miter box and need to know IF cutting crown molding is even possible... This was me on my first (and, thus far, only) time doing crown molding. I heard from everyone how a cheap and \"easy\" fix to making your house look more lux is to add some molding. Did you see that word? \"Easy.\" Ha! Apparently the authors of such articles never cut their own crown molding! Crown molding is anything but \"easy.\" However, out of hundreds of crown molding videos and tutorials, I finally found a trick that ACTUALLY WORKS and made it simple for me to understand exactly how to cut the corners without all the confusing ways to turn it and this and that. So I feel obliged to share this exciting AND SUPER EASY trick with you! So can you cut crown molding with just a miter box? YES! :) And I'm going to show you how! P.S. I do NOT profess to be a professional or a carpenter of any kind (and my work may show this), but I believe in spreading the helpful knowledge I learn to other noobs like me because even if it's not perfect, it's better than never trying in the first place. :)",

Using clamps here will definitely help.</li><li>So just remember, for EVERY cut you do, you'll follow the basic idea of:FLIP THE MOLDING OVER (so the \"bottom\" of the front of the molding is facing up), PRESS THAT BOTTOM UNDERSIDE FLUSH AGAINST THE MITER BOX, AND HOLD IT THERE WHILE YOU MAKE THE 45 DEGREE CUT.</li><li>Note: If your molding is too tall for the miter box, simply add a thin piece of wood behind it (such as a 1x4) so it sits flush against that while cutting. You can still reuse this piece once it's cut into at 45 degrees on both sides because then it will have slits matching those of your miter box, and it will be like an extension of your miter box.</li></ol>",

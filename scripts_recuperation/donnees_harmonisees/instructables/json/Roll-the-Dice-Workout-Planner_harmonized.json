    "intro": "Tired if your workout program? Getting bored during this pandemic? Change it up by adding some \"Chance\" to it. This project is so simple, you don't even need instructions. Just get a board. Use some moulding or thin strips of wood to make a frame around it. Glue or tack them in place. Write 12 of your favourite exercises on the board and number them. Roll a pair of dice and do the move that corresponds to the number on your dice. I do 8 moves per workout. I usually roll one die 4 times and the pair of dice 4 times to complete the workout. CAUTION: Do only routines that you know and are capable of doing and lift only weights you are comfortable with. A good plan is to consult a known workout manual like the one pictured. Have fun and stay healthy. PS: Don't forget to warm up first!",

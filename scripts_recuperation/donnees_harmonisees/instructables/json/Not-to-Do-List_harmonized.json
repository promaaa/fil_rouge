Stop procrastinating. Just delete the task. Anyone who thinks about tasks in this way will automatically make other choices and organize time differently. In these instructables you will learn which steps to take. You can download the lists or draw something yourself. in the maantime you will gain more insight into the reasons for your procrastination.But first I want to reassure you. You are not the only one who keeps putting off difficult jobs. You are in good company. In fact, about 20 to 25 percent of people see procrastination as an important characteristic of their personality. Research shows that procrastination is associated with characteristics such as fear of failure, shame and indecisiveness. Procrastinators have little confidence in themselves and are more likely to be pessimistic. They have a negative self-image. This is where a downward spiral begins. Postponing tasks causes guilt and stress. After that, it is even more difficult to break through the procrastination. In the popular book \"Eat That Frog,\" Brian Tracy described ways to stop procrastinating and get things done. The method teaches you to set priorities and plan them. This way you only work on the things that are actually important to you. Set achievable goals, divide your work into steps, and appreciate yourself for your efforts - not the results. The basis of this method remains, and we will supplement it with a new step. This 'Not To Do method' is based on Positive psychology.",

These are the things you are really not going to do. They are just as important as the things you will be doing. So write out the list completely, so that you can also cross things out later. Make sure there are at least 10 items on this list.</li><li>Tips to select the not-to-do items:</li><li>If you don't feel like eating frogs, get there in time. With some tasks you can probably already predict that you will dread it later. Chances are that such a task will become your 'frog'. Now is the time to cross out those tasks. Kill all tadpoles before they grow into frogs. If you already know that you are not going to achieve a difficult job, you do not have to take the first steps. Accept that it won't work. Ask someone else or skip the task right away.</li><li>At this time, there should be only feasible tasks on the list. Check if your day consists mostly of things that are important to you. The next step is to determine the best things on your list. Make them your cake, of something else you love to eat.</li><li>Important: You should absolutely not postpone the cake.<ul><li>Take your ToDO list. Why are those tasks on your list? Which are actually not that important to you? Don't try to cram as many things into your day as possible, just think about what you're doing.</li><li>Check if there are any tasks in the back of your mind that you should actually be doing. Write these down. Are there other things you don't feel like doing at all? Make sure there are at least 10 items on this list.</li></ul></li></ol>",

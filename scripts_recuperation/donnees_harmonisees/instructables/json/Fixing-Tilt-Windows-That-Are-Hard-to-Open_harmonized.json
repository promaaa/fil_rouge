    "intro": "I have vinyl windows that, over the years, have gotten harder and harder to open and close. I purchased the special spring tool, as well as several replacement parts, and managed to fix a couple of windows the expensive way - but today I'm going to teach you how to fix most of these window issues FREE (using household items). P.S. Hard to open windows can be annoying, but they can also be dangerous in an escape situation where someone who isn't very strong needs to climb out of the window.",

Make sure both sides are clicked back into place.</li><li>Here is where the physical part comes in.</li><li>You'll need to open and close that window at least a dozen times to spread the grease inside the inner workings of the twisted spring mechanism.</li><li>Take your time, don't slam or bang the window, lest you break the glass. You'll get better and better at it as you go along.</li><li>Once the window is moving smoothly across most of it's path, give it a few gentle motions towards the limits of the path (fully closed, and fully open). Once again, be extra gentle here so as not to slam and break anything.</li><li>Finally, why not use the opportunity to vacuum the little bits of things that always seem to fall out of the window while you're doing this. Usually dead bugs, dust, dirt, and other mysterious items that have gotten stuck up inside the mechanism over the years.</li><li>P.S. Get another person to try out your handiwork on the toughest of the windows in the house. If it's still to difficult for them to open, repeat the above steps. None of the windows in my house needed more than a second lubrication, and most of them only needed one.</li></ol>",

    "intro": "As a gymnast, a big problem I face every day is finding the best grip to achieve the best performance possible without any risk of slipping and injury. This is why I created the Sticky Solution! Gymnasts have always used honey chalk and water to create a nice grip, but recently in the US gymnasts started using a new product called \"tacky towel\" which is a towel made of beeswax, makes it sticky but hard to handle when used with chalk. By combining the honey and the wax it is created this sticky solution that makes it easy to work with chalk and creates a really good grip.",

    "intro": "Why would I need to standing up to pee?I don't.(Usually) Although owning a body is generally a cause for joy, everything has its exceptions. Living under an attack of sciatica is one of them. It creates a new range of needs. Among them, the ability to pee standing up. It happened to me last year. I was fine. 30 minutes later, I wasn't able to get up or sit down without howling in pain. 30 minutes more, and I wasn't able to stand up or to sit down by myself. Not even howling. I live alone, and I like it. It's only a problem when your body is malfunctioning or if you want to change the duvet cover. But I use blankets instead, and I also have good friends. That day, a good friend came over with food in tupperwares, lots of fruits and some painkillers. I had almost everything I needed to survive for a few days: water, food, the ability to take a shower and also to get in and out of bed (using a method that involved strange contortions, rolling movements, and a lot of arm strength, but was very effective). But I need, like every human being I know, to pee several times a day.I could not sit down and get up without help. Really, was I going to have to call a friend every time I needed to go to the bathroom? I tried to pee standing up using a jar. But you have to hold the jar under you, in a half-tilted posture that in a sciatic attack is also unfeasible. Also, there are medical devices for urinating lying down in a hospital bed, but they were not compatible with my strange ways of getting in and out of bed. There are ready-made items for women to pee standing up, which you can buy online. They are meant for camping or festivals. I don't know anyone who uses one. Problably because, in order to solve one problem, those things create a bigger one: If you're away from home, how do you manage it after you've used it? Where do you put it? (We handle menstrual cups out of home because, as you store it inside you, the storage problem is solved. And yet their use has a steep learning curve). But in my condition, and indoors, one of those devices would be the perfect solution. Since I didn't have one, and the problem was serious and urgent, I decided to build one with whatever I had at home.",

The longer the length, the better the aim, but the more messy it was to rinse it in the sink. The best \"aim-cleaning\" ratio, in my opinion, was achieved with a 15 cm long hose.</li><li>If you don't have a hose at home, here's plan B: you can make a tube out of a plastic sheet (for example, by cutting a rectangle from the cover of a notebook, a folder...) . Roll it up and tape it with duct tape.</li><li>This solution is worse, in two ways: it is less hygienic, and, as it is a rigid tube, it is more difficult to correct the trajectory of the liquid if you are not aiming well. But it works too.</li></ol>",

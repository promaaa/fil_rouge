For this reason, a rather non-standard solution was found: а conventional water valve (high-pressure valve) was taken as a basis and improved in such a way as to operate at low water pressure ..</li><li>To do this, I used the high-pressure valve itself, a float, and a ball from the bearing..</li></ul>"

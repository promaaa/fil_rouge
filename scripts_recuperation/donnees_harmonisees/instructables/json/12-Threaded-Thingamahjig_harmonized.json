It turns out that it is called a \"Lifting Eye\" and can be found using that search term in many shapes, materials and sizes - although they are not at all 'cheap.' I made mine from a scrap chain link found on the floor of a local Lowes where they stock and employees cut chain to length - it seems they seldom clean up after themselves! That and an old 1/2\" nut - makes two of us.",

Lifting Eye at McMaster Carr Thanks that was quick!</li><li>Well, I saved about eleven dollars!</li><li>Also, it turns out this approach to lifting a Septic Tank lid, was the brainchild of Alan, the owner-operator of A&R Septic of Hudson, NC Apparently, he's somewhat famous among the state's honey dipper crowd.</li><li>When the fellows came to drain my septic tank, they had to lift a solid concrete cover/lid about three inches thick and likely over a cubic foot of concrete designed and fabricated absent any sort of handle to lift the thing.</li><li>It had been years and years since we'd had it pumped and I cannot recall the struggle they must have endured to open up that tank. I might have been inside when they did that part - and again when they put it back in place.</li><li>The fellows that attended the tank this year were very nice, most professional and expeditious. Once they'd estimated where the tank was buried and thence where the lid was likely to be and uncovered it, they saw the problem and ran to get an impact drill and a 1/2 inch concrete drill bit. Once they'd drilled the hole, they inserted a concrete anchor, washer and nut and secured it in the hole leaving about 3/4 of an inch the threads exposed.</li><li>Then, they whipped out a nylon strap affair with a 1.5 inch diameter loop that had a 1/2 inch nut as part of the ring/circle/loop of steel. This loop was simply threaded onto the exposed threads securely and the strap passed though the loop so that each man might take an end and lift the heavy cover in a heavenly direction.</li><li>I was impressed. It turns out this was a technique the owner of the honey dipping service had invested and was known for throughout the (local) industry. I told him I was impressed and we have quite a conversation relative to the issues we were having during which I failed to ask him \"what's that loop/ring thing called?\"</li><li>Well, you know 'cause I put the name in the title. But, long after he left I had no idea what to type into Googol. I asked here and there and finally got an answer from a fella on the Woodworker's blog thing and a link to one on MacMastrer Carr(SP?) to find out that a nut welded to an old chain link could cost me eight bucks or more!</li><li>And, that's how this contest entry was engendered.</li></ol>",

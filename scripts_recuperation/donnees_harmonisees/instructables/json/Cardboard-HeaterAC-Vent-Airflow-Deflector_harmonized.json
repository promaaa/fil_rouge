    "intro": "My heater is in a corner and blows all the hot air out next to our sliding glass door, so I made a heat deflector/redirector to move the air into the center of the room instead. I tried a plastic one from Home Despot first, but it melted and deformed in 20 minutes into an unusable lump of plastic 🤔 Cardboard + aluminum duct tape + magnets = perfect solution and was basically free since I already had the supplies.",

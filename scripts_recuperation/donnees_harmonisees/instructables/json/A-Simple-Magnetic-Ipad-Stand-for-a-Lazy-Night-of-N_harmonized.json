    "intro": "Have you ever been lying in bed, watching something on an iPad propped up on your stomach, and had it slip and come crashing into your nose? This project lets you lie in bed and watch your iPad without that danger. (Of course, use it at your own risk. If the iPad slips out of the bracket, it will still hit you in the face.) This project came together at the start of COVID. It was made entirely from parts leftover from other projects, which was great for recycling. It has provided hours of movie-watching enjoyment for a couple of years now. Our bed has a headboard made from tubular steel, so magnets have no problem attaching it. For wooden headboards, we attach steel plates for the magnets to attach to. (Only on IKEA quality furniture. We don't do this to any of the fine woodworking pieces.) An example of attaching to a headboard made from a different material (e.g., wood) can be seen in our new instructable.",

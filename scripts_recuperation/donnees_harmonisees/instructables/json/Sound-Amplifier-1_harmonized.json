    "intro": "Sound Amplifier is an instrument to make any sound louder and replace the quietness in the surroundings. This can be used to educate or announce to a legion of people about something so they are able to hear the speaker and, music can be played louder during events. icrosoft Makecode is a browser-based coding platform for creating interactive and engaging programming experiences for those new to the world of programming. The platform provides the foundation for a tailored coding experience to create and run user programs on actual hardware (microbit in this case) or in a simulated target. In this Instructable, we'll develop a simplified version of coding a random music piece and test the buzzer with a prototype build with lego pieces to experiment what structure can amplify sound. Please note that I'll be testing the music in the MakeCode simulator as well as with microbit. You can test/play your programs in the simulator if you do not have any micro:bit.",

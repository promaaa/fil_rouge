    "intro": "A few years ago, a severe Texas snowstorm caught us off guard. Like many others who relied on electricity for heat, we found ourselves struggling to stay warm and safe as the power went out and temperatures plummeted. It was a painful reminder of how important it is to be prepared. The solution for us was to invest in propane heaters. LP (liquid propane) heaters are very efficient and safe. In this Instructable, you'll see the propane heaters I've tested and installed, providing us peace of mind during any power outage.",

I've watched countless videos and have read everything I could find on those Mr. Heaters.</li><li>I've come across a video showcasing the performance of the Mr. Heater in a small RV. In the video, it ran on HIGH for over 8 hours while being monitored by a CO2 detector. Throughout this duration, the CO2 level remained at ZERO, which confirms the heater's reliability and safety.</li><li>These Mr. Heaters have their own built in safety feature called the Oxygen Depletion Sensor (ODS). If it detects low oxygen in the room, the heater will automatically shut off. The heater will also shut off if accidentally tipped over.</li><li>In the picture above, I have two Mr. Heaters running in my very poorly insulated workshop. Despite outside temperatures being as low as 21 °F (-6 °C), I can maintain a cozy 75 °F (24 °C) inside.</li><li>If I ever get around to insulating the workshop, I'm sure one Mr. Heater will be more than enough.</li><li>I also placed the heaters on 1-foot square cement pads for added safety, although it wasn't really necessary.</li></ol>",

Simply screw the tank into the Mr. Heater, and you're good to go! For those upgrading to the 20-pound tanks, you'll need to either cut a hole or run the hose through a window, ensuring the tank remains outside.</li><li>As you can see, I'm using two heaters and two hoses, which I routed through two holes I created on the side of the workshop shed. Additionally, I acquired an LP gas splitter to connect both heaters to a single tank.</li><li>While CO2 detectors are not necessary, they certainly won't hurt. If you decide to purchase them, they can be easily mounted on a wall about 5-20 feet from the heater. Additionally, I used a gas leak detector to double check all of the hose connections.</li></ol>",

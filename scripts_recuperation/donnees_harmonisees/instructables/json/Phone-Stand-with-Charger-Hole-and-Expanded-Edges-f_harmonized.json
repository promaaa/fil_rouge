You should then stretch one to be a little larger than your phone in width, but smaller in height. This one should be at an angle as your phone will rest against it. The second rectangle should be a little larger than the base of your phone. This is important as most phones have wallets or bulky cases attached to the back of them, and this will allow a larger phone to sit on it.</li></ol>",

Firstly, write out a list of tasks to be completed. Rank the tasks in-order, in terms of importance and urgency. The more important a task, the higher it should rank on the list. This is a great way to visualize deadlines and can help outline a schedule.</li></ol>",

A quiet room with minimal distractions is an ideal place to begin working.</li></ol>",

Contrary to popular belief, multitasking actually decreases productivity by as much as 40%. Focus on completing a single task before beginning others.

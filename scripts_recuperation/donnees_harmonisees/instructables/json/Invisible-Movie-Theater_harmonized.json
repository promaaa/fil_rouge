We ordered it from a woodworking guy, but we've got to give him the dimensions. Here are some recommendations to consider:<ul><li>Height of the shelf. It shouldn't be too high, so it doesn't take too much space (thus you don't have a space for movie), but there also must be enough space for the flowerpots.</li><li>I can recommend splitting the shelf to separated boxes so when there is some water problem, it is limited in one box only.</li><li>Each box should be water tide.</li><li>It is nice to have the front panels removable so you can access the pots easily.</li><li>As you can see there is a hidden place for the screen.

Our reasonable budget was around $700 and thus almost impossible. I am not going to describe how to choose it based on the picture quality, there are other specialist for this, but here are some things related to this mad project:<ul><li>If you have a given distance from the screen (as we've got since the ceiling light was already in place), you must make sure theprojector can give you picture with right size for your screen. Most projectors have some zoom options which is helpful but not much. Just check the projector manual and do the math.</li><li>Because you don't want to hit your head to the projector when you are going for new snacks, the projector will be a bit angled. So, the project must be able to compensate the angle. Again, do the math for your specific scenario.</li><li>Dimensions are important too. Usually there is a limited space above the dry wall ceiling. So, height of the projector with the other stuff above must fit in. We have about 32cm height there so it's very generous and even so I was almost not able to fit it in.</li><li>Don't bother if the projector isn't smart. If your favorite projector is without Netflix app or other things, just use Chromecast or something similar.</li></ul></li></ol>",

Our dimensions are 500x25x4 mm. Which is reasonable for all important parameters like:</li><li>The biggest square that fits to our rounded light is with side about 54 cm so the length of the aluminium is 50cm. To each plate you must drill three holes (5mm diameter) for the screws. This is the hardest part since it must be very precise. The holes must be exactly at the same place for each plate. Otherwise, the scissors mechanism will not work smoothly. I just drilled first plate with maximum precision and then I placed this plate above second plate and drilled the holes to second plate through holes in the first plate.</li><li>When you have all plates ready with holes just put two plates above each other and tighten it with 5mm screws in middle holes. It is important to use a lock nut so it won't be loosed when the lift is moving up and down.</li><li>When you have prepared paired plates with middle screws you need to prepare threaded rods. Here it's just to cut it to proper length, which in our case was again 50 cm. Then put one lock nut to each side of the rod and you are ready for next step.</li><li>The next and last step is to put side holes of two paired plates together and put the threaded rod in the holes. Next put one lock nut to the end of the threaded rod. Repeat this until you have all plates and threaded rods together.</li><li>When all is together it is important to tighten all lock nuts just right. It cannot be too lose (the lift wouldn't be stable) or too tight (the lift wouldn't be moving).<ul><li>price</li><li>flexibility</li><li>strongness</li><li>weight</li></ul></li></ol>",

I am trying to win the Shelly contest, so I talk about Shelly there a lot :-D</li><li>As you can see in the video, after pressing one button there is several things that happens:</li><li>1) Lift, screen, and shades are going down using the Shelly 2PM.</li><li>2) Lights are dimmed and turned off using Shelly RGBW2.</li><li>3) Electricity for the projector is turned on using Shelly Plug and projector is set to turn on when it has a power.</li><li>4) Chromecast is turned on.</li><li>When I need to have it invisible again after the movie is finished, the scene is a bit different. I cannot just turn off the projector with the Shelly Plug because the lamp would be ruined soon. So, I turn off the projector with the remote and when the Shelly Plug notice, there is not a power (the projector turned off the fan) all is going to starting position with another scene in Home assistant.</li><li>It all could be controlled only with Shelly devices scripting, but since I am using Home assistant for other things I have it all done in Home assistant automations.<ul><li>Power up the Shelly (2PM with 230V, RGBW2 with 12V or 24V)</li><li>It will create wifi AP named shellyXXXXXXXXX</li><li>Connect your phone (laptop, pc) to the shelly AP and go to 192.168.33.1 in the browser</li><li>In the web UI setup connection to your wifi</li><li>You can set fixed IP, which is something I can recommend</li><li>Or you can just put wifi credentials and then you have to find what IP it has</li><li>Access the Shelly</li><li>Download Shelly Smart Control app to your phone and follow the inscructions there</li><li>Or go to the IP of the device</li></ul></li></ol>",

Here they are so you don't have to repeat them:</li><li>1) Too clumsy aluminium plates. I wanted to save some money so originally, I bought 500x15x2 aluminium. It was usable but lift movement was unstable.</li><li>2) The top position was reached when the stop button on the engine was pressed. Again, usable solution, but the stop button stopped working properly and the lift was trying to put it through the dry ceiling. It is better to set ending positions in the motor.</li><li>3) One safety screw for belt winding failed and the light was suddenly hold only on one side so it was angled, and the engine couldn't reach the stop button. The other belt was still working but connection in the bottom failed because of the force the engine was putting on it and the whole construction just fell. To fix this I used better safety screw and ditched the stop button and used ending positions set directly in the engine.</li><li>I was there when it happened. I saw something is wrong, but I couldn't stop the lift fast enough (I would have to open Home assistant app in the phone, find the lift etc.). So, after this disaster I made safety precaution. When I press any light switch in the room, the lift stop moving. It's again simple thanks to Shelly since under all my switches is some Shelly. So each time the switch is pressed, it toggle the light and also stop the lift.</li></ol>",

Initially, it was the Snapmaker A350T 3D printer that the object had to fit. Snapmaker with the enclosed chamber can be good for printing such items in materials like ABS or Carbon Fibre-type filaments, for example. The controlled environment in the enclosed chamber helps against warping.</li><li>The second printer of choice was Elegoo Neptune 3 Plus. Luckily, the same STL, without scaling a model, fit the print bed diagonally.</li><li>On large print beds like on Elegoo Neptune 3 Max (420 x 420 x 500mm), Anycubic Kobra Max (400 x 400 x 450mm) such a tool could be made even longer, approximately up to 500mm (19.6 inches) long.</li><li>The file can be adjusted to make it work on smaller printers just for the sake of the handle. Such a handle may be more comfortable to use.</li></ol>",

They are a trademarked name for a type of connector that are used to set up 12-volt devices so they can be connected in a variety of ways. They can also be used for other voltages. Each connector involves a red and a black plastic housing, each of which contains a metal contact. Assembling Powerpole connectors involves a special crimping tool and some skill at using the tool and inserting the resulting contacts into the red and black plastic housings. See https://youtu.be/QzLvdR6X81k</li><li>Parts: An LED Desk Lamp, a 12-volt battery (see discussion in Step 5), 4 or 6 15-amp Anderson Powerpole contacts, 2 or 3 red Powerpole housings and 2 or 3 black housings. Tools: Wire cutter, wire stripper, Powerpole crimping tool.</li><li>Notes:</li></ul>"

I recommend cutting it about six inches from the transformer/power supply that plugs into the wall. Some people refer to this as a \"wall wart\". Their purpose is to convert Alternating Current (AC) power in your home to Direct Current (DC) and lower the voltage to make it easier to use for many modern electronic devices. Because most automobiles, boats and RVs have 12-volt batteries, many but not not all DC devices use 12 volts and those that do often come with 12-volt wall warts so they can be used with grid power.</li><li>This photo also shows the crimping tool that will be used in a later step.</li></ol>",

If you don't have one, buy or borrow a 12-volt battery and install a red/black pair of Powerpole connectors on it with the red connector wired to the positive terminal and the black connector to the negative terminal. Popular types of 12-volt batteries are small AGM batteries and Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries. The one shown in the photo is a LiFePO4 battery.</li><li>In either case, turn off the lamp, disconnect the pair of Powerpole connectors on the wall wart cable and connect the battery's Powerpole connectors to the cable leading to the lamp. Turn the lamp back on. If it lights up, you're done!</li><li>Notes:<ul><li>AGM batteries are lead-acid batteries similar to automotive batteries but are designed to be used in applications where they are not immediately recharged. They are typically sealed so they don't give off gas and don't require that water be added.</li><li>An automotive battery could also be used but such batteries should not be used indoors unless they sealed and unvented.</li><li>The power cable that connects to the lamp may work with other 12-volt DC appliances that have the same power socket as your LED lamp. Be careful, however, because some appliances may assume positive on the inside of the barrel connector and others may assume negative.</li></ul></li></ol>",

However, my grandfather's brother primarily uses an app called WhatsApp to talk to people. WhatsApp is like a social media app where people can phone and video call one another, share updates about their lives statuses and send messages. It is relatively easy to use, but my grandfather needs some help understanding the logistics. This guide will help anyone who struggles to understand the intricacies of WhatsApp, people who are new to the app or people who are curious about the features of the app. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to a basic messaging app.",

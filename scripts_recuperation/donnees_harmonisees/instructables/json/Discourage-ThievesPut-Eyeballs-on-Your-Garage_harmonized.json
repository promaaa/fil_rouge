They would steal change or whatever they could find. Sometimes they did damage to the cars while they were trying to gain entry into them which just added insult to injury. I created my \"Low-Tech, Anti-Theft System\" in the hopes of having a chilling effect on these middle-of-the-night ransackings. See, there is a psychological phenomenon known as the “watching-eye effect.” Here's Wikipedia's take on it: Researchers have noted that even just the suggestion of being watched can be enough to get people to behave slightly less egregiously than they normally might. With that in mind, I decided to help my neighborhood out by putting giant eyeballs on the front of my garage which is just across the street from one of the theft-prone areas. And, I figured, even if the eyeballs didn't deter thieves, they just might delight the neighborhood kids (and, yes, fellow creative types like me), because I always thought the garage looked like a face with a big mouth that opens and closes. And these big eyes just really complete the look. . . Ready to give crime in your own neighborhood the hairy eyeball? Let's do this!",

If you have a large compass, you can use that to draw the largest circle (the iris of the eyeball) and adjust it to create a second, smaller circle (the pupil of the eyeball), and one more much smaller circle. (This last circle will serve as a white highlight inside the back pupil. It will help make your eyes look sparkly and more lifelike!)

Also, carefully paint a thin line all the way around the edge of the eye shape—kind of like giant eyeliner. (This will help each eye to \"pop\" once it is hanging up.)</li><li>While the black paint areas dry, you can turn your attention to the old magazines. Decide what you want your main eye color to be and tear out magazine pages with those dominant colors and interesting textures. If you're going for brown eyes, for instance, choose mostly shades of brown, black, dark purple, etc. Want green eyes? In that case, tear out pages with mostly green images—plants, grass, money, and so on. If you want blue eyes, look for aquatic scenes, blue skies, etc.</li><li>Tear different colored sections into pieces that are about an inch or two large. Don't be afraid to put slightly different colors and textures near one another. Your eyeballs will be hanging up high enough that you won't notice these disparities too much. In fact, mixing different colors that are in the same (or similar) color families will add extra life and dimension to your eyes.</li><li>Paint a small section of iris area with Mod Podge (or plain glue) and begin gluing the small pieces of torn magazine into this area, one piece at a time. Once each piece is in place, cover the top of it with a thin coat of Mod Podge (or glue.) Don't worry, it will dry clear. Continue the process of painting a small section of iris with glue, adding a few pieces, and painting over them until you've completed the irises of both eyes.</li><li>Allow the Mod Podge (or glue) to dry completely before going to the next step.</li></ol>",

While you could cover them with a thin layer of polyurethane or even several coats of shellac, I prefer to use two-part epoxy resin. (In my opinion, nothing else seems to provide quite the same thick, crystal clear coverage, and the effect is just really pleasing.)</li><li>Remember, for this resin-pouring step, you're going to need to wear some old clothes or an apron and latex gloves in order to protect your hands and clothing. You will also need a plastic tarp, two clean buckets, paint-stirring sticks, and a plastic squeegee/trowel.</li><li>Your mixing and application instructions may vary a little bit depending on the two-part epoxy product you choose. (I most often use Glaze Coat and, from the time the two parts have been combined, I usually have 10 to 15 minutes to apply and manipulate the product before it begins to set up.)</li><li>Before you begin mixing and pouring the epoxy, place each of your giant eyes on top of the plastic tarp. (Although you should try to be as neat and judicious as possible, you likely won't be able to avoid having some of the resin running off of the edges of your eyes.)</li><li>MIX AND APPLY RESIN</li><li>Repeat these steps for the other eye. If you have a helper you trust, you may be able to mix enough resin to do both eyes at once. Otherwise, plan to mix just enough to cover one eye at a time.</li><li>Once covered with epoxy, leave the eyes in place to dry and cure. How long this will take depends on the product you use, the thickness of the coat you poured, and the ambient temperature in the area. Curing usually takes at least a couple of days. To test the degree to which your epoxy has cured, find an out-of-the-way spot on one of the eyeballs and see if you can make an indentation on its surface with your fingernail. If you can make a mark, your eyeballs need extra curing time.<ul><li>Mix two-part epoxy according to manufacturer's instructions. (Most kits require a couple of clean buckets and paint stirring sticks for this step.)</li><li>Pour a small amount of resin onto the center of one of your eyes such that it slowly creeps across the eye and maybe even drips off of the edges a little bit.</li><li>Use your squeegee to help direct the movement of the epoxy while it is still wet and workable.</li><li>If you see small bubbles on the surface, you can usually blow on these and they will come up to the surface and burst. (Alternatively, you can use a heat gun or hair dryer to remove these bubbles.)</li></ul></li></ol>",

    "intro": "I find that it is often easier to go to sleep in front of the television set than than in bed. Watching TV in bed would be nice, but my wife does not share my preference. I have discovered a way to escape to TV land without disturbing my loving spouse. This method does not provide video, but since I have my eyes closed anyway, what difference does that make. This Instructable will let you to listen to any available broadcast TV show privately and for free. If you look around a bit, this Instructable should cost you very little, if anything at all; but you may have to raid your father’s/grandfather’s closet to find some of the parts. Background - About 20 years ago, TV broadcasting moved from analog to digital, and everyone ran out and bought a digital converter box so they could watch the new format on their old set. Some of us, and probably your grandpa, still have one or more of these sitting on a shelf somewhere. On the back of the digital converter, you should find a right and left audio output. I was surprised to learn that these are both live whenever the converter is on. In order to get this project working, all you have to do is plug an antenna (rabbit ears should work) into the “antenna in” port of the converter, do an autoscan to tune in available channels, and hook up earbuds.",

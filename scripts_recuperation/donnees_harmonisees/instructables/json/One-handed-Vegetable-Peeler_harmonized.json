There are safety concerns with how he currently peels and it is time consuming. Our team took on the challenge to design and build a simple solution to allow Aaron to peel vegetables so he can enjoy cooking again.",

He used a strip of bicycle inner tube as a grip and held with the peeler between his legs and used his hand to peel the potato.</li><li>To get an idea of his needs, we asked if he wanted a portable product, what kinds of vegetables he peels, and if he wanted something that was automated.</li><li>Aaron indicated he wanted a product that is as simple as possible, without any moving parts or automation, that can hold the peels and can go on his countertop.</li></ol>",

After a couple of unexpected printer errors that would cause us to reprint twice, a prototype was made.</li><li>This prototype was rough but an amazing learning experience. Here are some of the discoveries we made:</li><li>From here, we got some advice from mentors and brainstormed methods for making a better design. The changes made for the final prototype were:</li><li>We met with Aaron so he could try out our prototype and give us some feedback. He let us know what he liked on our prototype and gave us more ideas to make improvements. Overall, it was a great meeting that sparked our next efforts into our final prototype, which would only need a few minor adjustments.<ul><li>the surface was covered with the support layers for the print, making it a lot of work to clean up and smooth out</li><li>the holes for attaching the pieces were extremely weak and brittle because of the orientation we printed them</li><li>the final problem was that the cutout to fit the blade was too small and did not allow us to fit the peeler blade into the design.</li><li>editing the dimensions to better fit the blade</li><li>added a chamfer to all the corners</li><li>removed the print in leg joint and changed it to a similar joint to the clamp piece and middle piece by using a wooden dowel. This will make it easy to disassemble and store and clean each component as necessary</li><li>increased the thickness of the dowel joints so that they will have more durability</li></ul></li></ol>",

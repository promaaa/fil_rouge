Using the flat blade razor scrapper I was able to carefully lift the corners of the film enough to get the pliers to grip the film. With the pliers and the scrapper I slowly pulled the film free from the mirror. What worked best for me was to work inwards from the four corners. Be sure to pull upwards, away from the mirror as the pliers will slip off the film as you pull it. Eventually you will remove all of the film.</li></ol>",

    "intro": "The battery powered coffee grinder from Tchibo is a great little helper if you like to grind your own coffee and want a compact grinder. However, the batteries show some degradation over time and will not last for more than one load of beans before you need to recharge. Replacing the batteries would be one solution to the problem. As we always use the grinder at home, adding a possibility to use a USB-PD power supply instead, seemed a better option. The grinder happens to have enough interior space available to add a USB-PD module. With this modification, it will still operate on the rechargeable battery, but will also run on the additionally installed USB port on the breakout board. I have not added a switch, so it will operate as soon as a proper USB power supply is connected.",

    "intro": "Recent societal events have made waking up in the morning a lot harder. Even the irritating “alarm” sound on my iPhone won’t cut it anymore. I wanted to find another mechanism to help me wake up in the morning. A paper published to PubMed, a database containing biomedical and life sciences journal articles plus other related content, described how heat can disrupt sleep and that it is better for humans to sleep under cooler conditions (link here). Also, an article by sleep.org described how “most experts agree the best temperature for sleep falls between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15.6 to 19.4 degrees Celsius) … as an increase in body heat can cause you to wake up” (link here). Knowing that information, I took it upon myself to find tools that many people may already have at home to try and make my morning wake-up process easier. As a result, with some tools that you can find around the house or purchase cheaply, here is how you can use heat to help aid your morning wake-up process!",

Whether it is their morning routines when getting ready for work, their work routine, their cooking routine, or even their bedtime routine, people tend to stick to routines that make their life easier. One extremely popular routine for many people is putting on makeup on a day to day basis. The Unilateral Mascara Holder is a unique device that would benefit an individual with decreased functional strength on one side of their body. This would be referred to as hemiparesis. The Unilateral Mascara Holder is a portable base support to hold makeup products in place and make them easily accessible and stabilized to unscrew the top or lid of the product. This would save not only time but additionally prevent any difficulties for the user during their routine. The base of the candle holder makes it easily portable and aesthetically pleasing, the small piece of seating foam holds the products in place and the Velcro on the bottom keeps the holder sturdy and attached to whatever surface it is being used on. The beauty of the Unilateral Mascara Holder is that it can be used nearly anywhere!",

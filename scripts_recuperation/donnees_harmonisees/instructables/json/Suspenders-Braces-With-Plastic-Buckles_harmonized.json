    "intro": "I use suspenders / braces instead of belts and generally buy the cheap kind, I don't care how they look since I wear them under my untucked shirt. I just prefer them to belts since I don't like the tight feeling around my waist and they feel more secure. However, the cheap ones come with cheap clasps that aren't up to much and break easily. So here I have replaced the clasps with sturdy plastic buckles. Some people use metal trigger hooks, which are good too, but I find they can be cold against the skin and pluck hairs from my hairy belly, which is annoying. Also, taking down your pants in the toilet doesn't require any disrobing - just pop the plastic buckles - click, clack, very satisfying. Also I'm think plastic buckles might get through metal detectors at airports which is nice.",

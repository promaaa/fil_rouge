    "intro": "Everyone receives many items of junk mail that do not take long on their journey to the recycling bin. A lot of these items are only printed on one side - I keep these. I also keep other single-side printed items such as 10 pin bowling score sheets and printer test pages. Using slide binders left over from my very first Instructable I clip such items together to make useful scribble pads.",

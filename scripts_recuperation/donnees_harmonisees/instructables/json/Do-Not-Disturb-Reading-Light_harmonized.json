The version shown is just a little different from the one I have, but basically the same. A magnet on the back holds it on any steel surface.</li></ol>",

The hot spot is not as stark as the photo would lead one to believe. But, I also find it very easy to place the hot spot where I am reading at the moment. I find it a very satisfactory reading experience. Read reviews of commercially available reading lights and they do not always provide even lighting for a whole page, either.</li><li>Update: I did buy one of the new style lights shown in the previous step. It illuminates more widely and more evenly without a hot spot.</li></ol>",

Its background is a cutting grid my wife uses for sewing projects. The squares are one inch in size.</li><li>I used a scrap piece of 16 gauge steel that formed a long, narrow right triangle. I needed to convert it to an isosceles triangle. I drew a centerline from the point of the right triangle to the base line of it. I used a square to draw a new baseline perpendicular to the centerline and trimmed the right triangle to make it an isosceles triangle.</li><li>I trimmed excess from the top or point end of the triangle and bent a right angle to fit under the light when it rests on my chest. I made another right angle bend where the sheet steel crests the top of the light. See the second photo. After you are finished, adjust the second bend as needed so the light points where you want it when in use and resting on your chest.</li></ol>",

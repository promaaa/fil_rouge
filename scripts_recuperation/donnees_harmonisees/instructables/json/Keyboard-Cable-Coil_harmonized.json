Caution: I would not advise to do this with some very expensive equipment (or cables for hard drives etc...), as the winding of the cable might maybe put too much stress on it. A more expensive keyboard, on the other hand, should already have some anti-cable-clutter(I googled it and of course landed back at instructables ;))-gadget.",

I left some 5 to 6cm in the beginning of the cable and ~12cm at the end. Be careful to do this evenly. You can press the cable a little bit into the spring with your fingers. Note that you can approximate the numbers of windings you need for the length of cable you want to wind up. The estimation would be:</li><li>Length of cable to wind up / [(spring diameter - cable diameter) x pi].</li><li>Don't worry if you are not happy at the first time. I actually needed three attempts, until I thought it looked good. Unwinding it from the coil also didn't harm the cable in my case.</li></ol>",

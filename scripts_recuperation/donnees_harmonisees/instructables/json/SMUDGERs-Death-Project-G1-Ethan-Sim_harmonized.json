    "intro": "I wanted to built a more special sound amplifier inspired by games structure and animation drawings. I name it SMUDGER’s Death Project G1. It look like a red cranky crane, There is a front black portion lego piece which I named it Smudger to be lifted by the CRANKY crane. I made all red because red is like electricity. Placing the microbit and buzzer into the bottom red slot, it is as if the crane is screaming out loud.",

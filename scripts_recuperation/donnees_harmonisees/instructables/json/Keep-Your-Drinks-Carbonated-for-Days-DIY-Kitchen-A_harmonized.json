There's almost nothing more disappointing than a soda drink with no bubbles. So I thought, there should be a simple solution for this! But I couldn't find one online, so I made one! Some people told me this could be made for profit, but honestly, I don't want to do that :) Hope you enjoy my project and make your own!",

        "Supplies<ul><li>I tried a bunch of different technique before posting this instructables - I made like 10 different versions of a 3-D printed air valves, but none were good enough. Eventually I decided to use a Schrader valve (the standard valve used in bicycles and cars). This turned out to be the simplest (and cheapest!) solution.</li><li>Here's a link to the valves I used (not an affiliate link). I tried a few other cheap ones, but these worked the best. Feel free to use any other valve though :)</li><li>You'll also need a suitable air pump (I didn't attach a link to this one, because mine broke just after a few weeks)</li></ul>"

It turns out that by keeping the bottle pressurized, bottles cannot form and escape the liquid. This happens because dissolved CO2 takes less volume than CO2 in gas form, and by keeping a the bottle pressurized we're not letting those bubbles expand and form. So, the equilibrium state of the soda bottle is a state where the bubbles are dissolved in the liquid.</li><li>When we buy soda bottles they come pressurized (you can feel that the bottle is rock hard), but once we open them the pressure is released and the equilibrium state changes! Now, bubbles want to form and escape the liquid. It's not all bad news! We want this to happen, because otherwise we wouldn't get any fizziness when we drink it! The C02 would remain dissolved for ever.</li><li>But what happens when we want to keep the soda drink carbonated for a later time?</li><li>Well, if we keep the cap tight, bubbles can still escape the liquid! They keep escaping until the air pressure inside the bottle is high enough to stop them, but if your bottle has enough room in it, plenty of gas can escape the liquid before the formation of bubbles seize. This is why 90% full soda bottles remain carbonated longer than 50% full soda bottles do!</li><li>Solution to the Problem - Soda Companies Wished You Didn't Know This!</li><li>To stop the bubbles from escaping, we can actively pressurize the bottle (pump air to make the pressure higher) once we're done drinking!</li><li>This works like magic - one moment you see bubbles escaping the liquid (practically going to waste!) and a moment later (after you pressurize the bottle) the is no more bubble formation!</li></ol>",

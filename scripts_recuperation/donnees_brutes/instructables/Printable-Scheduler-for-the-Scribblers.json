That’s why I’m excited to share one of my favorite long-term companions: a printable scheduler. While I find Google and Teams calendars useful, there's something uniquely motivating about creating my own paper schedule at the start of each week. It gives me that personal push to stick to my plans. I hope others on Instructables share this passion for writing, so here’s a step-by-step guide to making your own scheduler.",

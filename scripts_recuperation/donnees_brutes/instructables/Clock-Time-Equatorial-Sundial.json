I ended up designing my own equatorial sundial with an adjustable time dial that could be set for accurate clock time. This has worked out so well that I have had friends and colleagues requesting I make them a few!",

If you have a CNC you could potentially make this out of metal plates. You will also need acrylic poster paint to pill in the etched lines. I went a bit crazy and painted the continents with a bronze color and the oceans with a blue acrylic paint. And then covered these with an acrylic varnish."

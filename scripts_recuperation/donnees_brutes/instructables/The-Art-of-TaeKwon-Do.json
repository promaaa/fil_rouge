I am a black belt in Unified TaeKwon-Do International, I’ve been training in TaeKwon-Do for eleven years and teaching all ages in a class format for the last 5. Did you know that learning even basic defense skills could save your life? Today I’m going to be showing you 4 common attacks in a fight, and how to defend yourself.

TaeKwon-Do translates to “The Art of The Hand and Foot”, which speaks to the fact that there is a mix of both hand and foot techniques, and some aspects mix punches and kicks together. There are 3 main TaeKwon-Do Federations, World TaeKwon-do, which is the version of TaeKwon-Do seen in the Olympics, they focus more on the combat aspect using more kicks than punches because they train with rifles due to the military background. International TaeKwon-do, they focus more on the non-combat aspects of TaeKwon-do, and then finally Unified TaeKwon-do which attempts to have an even combination of combat and non-combat.",

Experiments have found that when a man attacks a woman in public, many people assume that they are in some sort of domestic relationship, and they are more reluctant to intervene when they believe this is the case. In a case like this the best thing to do is scream, or Yell something along the lines of “Why are you doing this? I don’t even know you!” or “Who are you?”, this ensures that people know that they can intervene in a situation without complicating things.",

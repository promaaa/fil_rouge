An attempt to pass off the tight weave’s very audible evisceration as a much ruder sound from an entirely different source was futile. The damage was done.

                    "Literally ANY kind that you can get your hands on will work for this technique. Don’t be intimidated by different gauges or shape choice. To help you make an informed purchase, however, there are three main needle shapes that could prove useful for this purpose: triangle, star, and spiral (twisted). There are also multiple gauges, higher numbered gauges are in fact smaller in size than lower numbered gauges. The gauge numbers are 32, 36, 38, 40, and 42. Gauges 32 and 42 are rarer and harder to find than the others, so you can ignore them. You also might find that the felting needles are labeled something like “fine” and “coarse”, these will also work. A good rule of thumb to follow, use a fine gauge (40 for instance) for finer/tighter upholstery weaves and a coarse gauge (36 for instance) for looser/coarser upholstery weaves.",

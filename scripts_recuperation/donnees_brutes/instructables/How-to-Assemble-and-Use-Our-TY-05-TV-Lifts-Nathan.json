The TV lift mechanism is also what allows for extra space saving by hiding your TV when it is no longer needed. Prior to the assembly of our TV lift, Chad from Broke OverLand had previously used our products for a Bed Lift System and Dinette Table for an LMTV camper which also helped him to save space in a small area. In this instructable, Chad covers the steps and procedures involved to install our TY-05 Drop-Down TV lift – although our motorized TY-05 can come with different stroke length options to better suit certain sized TVs, the overall steps for assembly and operation will still be similar for all TY-05 models.",

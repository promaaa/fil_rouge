So, we all know it's important to have charged devices, but often times the battery on our phone doesn't last the whole day, and it's hard to always remember to plug it in sometimes. Because of this, I decided to create a portable handheld phone charger. To use this, all you'd need to do is slip your phone into the secure compartment, and a charger connects, charging while in your hand. With this, your phone will never be dead!",

My pictures may not be super clear, but the important thing is that I understand what I drew. I'm not the best artist - but that's okay because you don't have to be. As long as you can make out the concepts and ideas you put on paper clearly, you're okay. One thing I personally like to do that helps is label parts of my design. Another tip is to draw things from different angles.",

The charger is a relatively simple design, as I started off with a platform for the base. Your platform can be any color, but once you make it a certain color, I think it looks best to keep the rest the same color. Once I added the phone, I used two skinny rectangular prisms - one sticking straight up and the other one at about a 45 degree angle, as the things securing the phone. I repeated this on the other side. Then, I added the right shape for the base of the charger, and used another basic shape as the charging part. Lastly, I added a little wall that the base charger will be placed against, as you can see in my pictures.",

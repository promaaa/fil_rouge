A little investigation revealed that she had been walking around in the dark rather than turning on the ceiling light to save on electricity and because it was too bright at night. It appeared that an existing small plug-in night-light on the landing was not providing sufficient illumination to prevent trips and falls.",

I had previously tried using discrete white 0.2\" LEDs and a capacitive dropper / bridge rectifier / electrolytic capacitor as a bathroom night-light, but the LEDs were not really bright enough, and failed after only a few months, despite being run well within their data-sheeet ratings. However, it did show that the dimming circuit could be successfully housed within the ceiling pull-switch. (See image.)",

(A series resistor was included to limit surge current, improve reliability, and act as a fuse.) I tried that scheme in our bathroom, again mounting the components inside the ceiling pull-switch. Result - an excellent night-light, with full brightness available at the pull of a cord, which has now worked perfectly 24/7 for months.",

Well, I don't know about the rest of the world, but a lot of UK lighting circuits use a combined mechanical mounting base, electrical junction box, and lampholder, called a ceiling rose and pendant. The ceiling rose includes terminals for switched live, permanent live, neutral, and earth. (Also sometimes marked as Line, Loop, Neutral, and earth.) Connecting the capacitor between the permanent live and switched live terminals inside the existing ceiling rose gave ideal night-time illumination, with full-brightness available at any time using the usual two-way switches at the top and bottom of the stairs.",

(For reliability, the capacitor must be at least X2-type 250V AC rated.

Please ensure that the circuit is completely isolated at the fusebox / consumer unit / circuit breaker panel before making any modifications to the circuit. Also, always turn the lighting circuit off at source when changing the bulb at any time. In 'dim' mode, the current is limited to a few milliAmps by the series capacitor, but is still enough to give an uncomfortable electric shock if unwary fingers get into the lampholder.",

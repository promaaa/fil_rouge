The idea is that these tongs would be used for snacking to prevent your fingers from getting dirty. The tongs are meant to used for any type of snack. Chips that get your fingers dirty, fruits that get your fingers slimy, or any other type of snack. This idea came to me when I was playing games on my laptop and snacking at the same time. I would snack then get the keyboard dirty with the chip residue. I realized I could create something to prevent my keyboard, phone, desk, or anything else from getting dirty. The tongs go in between your fingers and thus preventing from dirtying anything else.",

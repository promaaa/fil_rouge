So if a price opens up at 100 dollars a share in the morning, falls to 95 dollars by midday and then rallies to close the day at a price of 105 then the candlestick would look like a green bar with a stick hanging out of the bottom. Its green because the closing price was higher than the opening price and the stick on the bottom tells us that the price fell lower than shot back up. If it it had stayed at 95 instead of coming to 105, it would just be a red bar which tells us that the stock lowered in price over that time.",

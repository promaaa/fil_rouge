She is reluctant to keep the car running all the time just for the AC so I decided to make this portable cooler AC to make the wait more bearable. I wanted to make something small enough to sit on the center console of her minivan. It also had to be powered by a car or a portable battery.",

Other solutions blow air into a cooler filled with ice before exhausting it through a vent. More sophisticated solutions use a fan to blow air through a radiator that has cold water circulating through it. I decided to go with a combination of the last two techniques. I figured blowing air over the ice would melt the ice slower while the radiator option would provide colder air but the ice would melt faster. I wanted to create something that would allow you to choose between the two modes.",

I put the pump in the middle of the back wall and the switch next to it. Glue the pump platform to the cooler bottom (roughen the surfaces with some sandpaper) and attach the switch bracket to the back wall. Make sure the height of the bracket is above the pump so that the switch turns on when the water is just above the pump. Once the glue is dry, bolt the pump to the platform and slip the switch and the protective cylinder into the bracket. Make sure everything is tight. Wrap the switch wire around the pump wire to keep things tidy. I used a few zip ties attached to some mounts to keep the wires in place.",

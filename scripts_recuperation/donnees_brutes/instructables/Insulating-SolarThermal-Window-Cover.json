This black side faces out towards the sun. The sun shines on the black Solar/Thermal Window Cover and it gets hot. The hot air flows upwards towards the top and exits at the top curtain rod assembly. Then cooler air is drawn from below and the cycle repeats continuously all day and cloudy days too. You will definitely notice a warmer room in no time and if you keep the door closed you may not have to turn on the central heat to heat that room during the day, thus saving money, fuel and the atmosphere. I'll never cease to wonder why I had not learned about this before as some standard knowledge so it is up to me to share it with you.",

                    "It's quite likely the smallest length you can find locally will be 10 ft (which should cost you between $5 and $10), in which case see if the store will cut it for you into 5 (24in) or 6 (20in) pieces, depending on how tall you want the pump to stand. For my kitchen, I used 19 inches although in hindsight I might have been better advised to use 21 inches.",
                    "You can cut it yourself. Getting a perfect square cut is not essential for this project. I cut mine quite easily with a Dremel cut-off rotary saw blade.",
                    "2) An electric water pump. Generally these are rather cheaply made Chinese products and I suspect they'll all very similar inside with just different case stylings for different vendors. They cost between $5 and $15.",
                    "The one I have was bought in 2020 for $10 and has worked well for 5 years now, but unfortunately it is no longer available so you'll just have to read the Amazon reviews and pick something yourself. (Mine was: Electric Water Bottle Pump Auto Drinking Water Jug Water Dispenser for Universal 5 Gallon Bottle which cost $10 in 2020.)",
                    "3) Food-grade silicone tubing of an appropriate length that fits your water pump. I think it's usually 1/4in inside diameter (ID) and 3/8in outside diameter (OD) but I can't be 100% sure. I've also seen roughly similar tubing described as 6mm ID and 9 or 10mm OD. I tested this project with some PTFE tubing I had bought for another purpose so the default dimensions in the OpenSCAD file reflect that tubing. This will cost about $1 per foot. (I recently bought 10 ft for $7 at Amazon). My setup uses 40 inches.",
                    "If you want to get fancy you could consider one with a weight but I consider that particular example somewhat overpriced. But at least you can sterilize the weight and use it again with new tubing."

The finished device is quite stable - you'ld think with that long stem that it might wobble, but the tolerances are tight enough that it's good and solid. If you make one and it wobbles, measure your bottle neck and your pump neck and tweak the parameters in OpenSCAD until it fits better.

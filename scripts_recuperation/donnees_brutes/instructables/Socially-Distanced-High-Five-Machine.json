After seeing some inspiration from a teacher in the Netherlands, I decided I wanted to make my own socially distanced high five machine out of mostly PVC piping!",

I chose not to glue it together, since I often need to move and store it, so I wanted to be able to quickly take it apart and put it back together, but you could easily use PVC cement to keep it all together (which would be especially helpful if you have some very excited kids trying it out)!",

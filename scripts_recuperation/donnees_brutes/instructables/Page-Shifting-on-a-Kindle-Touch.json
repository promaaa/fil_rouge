There are benefits to be found in a study of the Old Testament by way of biblical Hebrew, even if you struggle with it. We all do for a very long time. Quite a few Christians do take it upon themselves to learn some Hebrew. Some become quite proficient at reading it. The best advice for gaining proficiency at biblical Hebrew is to read lots of Hebrew. Although some reader's editions have appeared in recent years, I find a parallel version is most helpful to me. St Jerome has a famous quotation on his difficulties at learning Hebrew. He says it brought him a great deal of misery, as those close to him could attest, and he quit many times. But, something always drew him back to it. Finally, he was reaping the sweet rewards on his labors.",

When the dust settled, it turns out that being a parent is tiring. Apparently, babies don't sleep that well, and one of the things that helped his baby boy fall asleep was swinging his stroller back and forth. He said that they're swinging the stroller about 5 (!!) hours a day, so this problem had to be solved. They tried to buy a motorized stroller swinger online, but couldn't find a decent solution. He wanted something portable so he could use it at different spots around the house. It took a really long time to make working prototype (you can see my failed attempts at the bottom), find the right engine, and shipments from china took a really long time. So by the time it was ready, he didn't need the stroller rocker for his baby boy anymore... But then, he told me they're having a baby girl. So, long overdue, I made this motorized stroller rocker.",

It's actually a broken part from a microscope that I didn't want to throw out. This object doesn't have to be round, but it should have a sufficient diameter (a single stroke of the stroller swinger will be twice it's radius/length).",

If you go over my instructable you'll see what it takes to assemble your own stroller-rocker, and then it's all about gathering the materials.

It took me a while to find a decent one for a fair price, and this one optimizes both aspects (12V, 47RMP, 33kg/cm torque). A speed controller could be useful as well (different babies need different conditions to fall asleep). I bought mine along with the motor. A different lower RPM motor would work just as well, as long as it has sufficient torque.",

But apparently, 3D printed parts can be a bad idea sometimes! . 3D printed objects rely on the adhesion of each layer to the next. So, for a 3D printed part to fail, on one of the layers has to fail. In my case, the connector holding the swinging arm and the rotating disc broke, so we had to fix it (see 3rd image). I'll show you the fix in the next step, but first...",

The first one was based on a linear actuator controlled by an Arduino and a Bluetooth-connected app (see 4th image). This was really nice to play with, and taught me quite a lot, but it was over-complicated. Making gentle, speed controlled, strokes using a linear actuator is not simple (you need to keep track of it's position and so on). The simplest way to make a gentle motion is by having a sinusoidal motion - transfer circular motion (rotation) to a linear one. Moreover, I wanted to make this product available to as many people as possible, and as popular as Arduino is for tinkerers, most people are still unfamiliar with it. These two reasons made me abandon the old design for the new one :) Let me know what you think!",

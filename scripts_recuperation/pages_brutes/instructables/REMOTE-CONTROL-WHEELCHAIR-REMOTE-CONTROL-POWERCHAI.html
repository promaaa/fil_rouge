            <span class="author-link"><a class="more-link" href="https://www.instructables.com/member/veliko/" rel="author">More About veliko »</a></span></div></div><div class="step-body"><p><strong><u>BACKGROUND</u></strong> I am not an electrical engineer nor a mechanical engineer or an engineer in any field. I’m just an average guy who fixes things around the house as best I can. I’m a tinkerer and a maker. But because I’m in a wheelchair, being a handyman is a bit more challenging for me, however, I’m still able to do almost anything, albeit, not always in the most conventional ways.</p><p>One such challenge is, what to do with my powerchair when I transfer myself to the rider mower or my moped trike.</p><p>The solution has always been to have someone else ride the wheelchair “out of the way”. This wasn’t a problem, but still not self-sufficient for me.</p><p>I wanted the ability of NOT having to depend on someone to move my wheelchair out of the way for me and then bring it back to me later.</p><p><strong><u>SOLUTION</u></strong> The remote wheelchair design I made, is a rather crude prototype and since I’m not an engineer, was done in a simple mechanical fashion with just the tiniest knowledge of electronics.</p><p>I can now get close to the mower, transfer myself onto it, and remotely move the powerchair out of the way.</p><p>Before starting, it’s important to know that this project was not to create a remotely controlled RACER wheelchair, but rather an aid for people in the same position (and attitude) as myself.</p><p>I know people are reading this with hundreds of other ideas of how to accomplish this, so this is mine, of many.</p><p><strong><u>CHALLENGES</u></strong> One of the biggest challenges was the joystick controller. I wanted the joystick on the chair to react perfectly in sync with the remote I used.</p><p>This was difficult because if the push-pull servo wasn’t in perfect alignment with the joystick, pushing forward on the remotes Y-Axis would not always push the chair’s remote perfectly forward, drifting a few degrees and causing the X-Axis to also move a bit either left or right. Although not a big problem since it could be easily compensated for by pushing forward AND left/right to compensate for the difference, I still wanted to be as precise as possible – using the method in this project.</p><p>I'd also like to point out that because I lack knowledge of circuit boards, I chose to use a switch to toggle between the "regular" joystick controls and the remote controlled joystick. Perhaps it would have been ok to splice the remote controlled directly into the existing one BUT power chairs have so many electronics built in that I did not want to take the chance of possibly burning out any components.</p><p><strong><u>STARTING</u></strong> This project was created out of a need for a solution to a problem few people are aware of. It isn’t for racing a wheelchair, so the servos I used here and the way I use them, don’t push the XY axis on the wheelchair to its maximum speed. I modified some 3D printed parts and used an RC controller and receiver, springs, screws, servos, wood, glue, Dremel, and tools.</p></div></section><section class="step" data-stepid="" id="stepsupplies"><h2 class="step-title">Supplies</h2><div class="step-body"><p><strong>These are MY parts list.

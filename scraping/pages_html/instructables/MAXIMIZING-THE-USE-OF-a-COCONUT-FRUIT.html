It grows along beach shores, mountain sides, and residential areas where tree owners can easily harvest its fruits for consumption or for the production of coconut-related goods. The tree is visible in almost every part of our country.</p><p><br/></p><p>The coconut tree has a wide array of use: the coconut trunk is used in constructing "nipa huts" ---traditional houses that are usually found in rural parts of the country. The coconut leaves are good materials in crafting decorations and their centermost fiber are sticks that can be extracted and bundled together to create raw stick brooms which is a common tool for backyard cleaning. The coconut white and its juice serve as a fragrant condiment for foods and are also used as the main ingredients for the production of palm oil. The shell that holds the fruit is most likely to be thrown after having the coconut white removed but in some parts of the country, they are burned in a fireplace to produce coals.</p><p><br/></p><p>The rampant use of coconut shells in our hometown Natonin (with coordinates: 17.1286°N, 121.2855°E), a municipality found in the eastern part of Mountain Province, began since time untraceable. The use of the old-fashioned bowl is influenced by our ancient cultures and traditions which are strongly connected to nature.</p><p><br/></p><p>The people are using the coconut shell as an alternative material for commercial bowls on occasions that require massive production of food for a number of people to be served. The coconut bowl which is called "fa'-a" in our native dialect is an indigenous product that serves as a receptacle for food and soup during gatherings like birthdays, weddings, and wake for the dead. It is also excellent for its original function as a cup for "tapuy": a type of wine that is made from fermented rice. "Tapuy" comprises of "epo" and cooked rice mixed together for preservation. The "tapuy" is left covered and kept for a time until the bitter-tasting liquid comes out.</p><p><br/></p><p>The coconut bowl is rarely recognized as an eating tool in the more civilized regions of the country especially in urban cities because of the changes in people's lifestyle. One would not care remodelling an organic material into a more functional product unless he/she knows the significance of the object to life. To us who grew up witnessing the uses of the coconut bowl in our celebrations, we would value the role it plays in our lives, but it does not mean that we are not progressing in the way we approach life as time passes. </p></div></section><section class="step" data-stepid="" id="stepsupplies"><h2 class="step-title">Supplies</h2><div class="step-body"><p>• A healthy coconut fruit </p><p> • Cutting tools (bolo, knife, etc.) </p><p> • Pencil </p><p> •Sander</p></div></section><section class="step" data-stepid="SQ11ZD4LDEJCMVR" id="step1"><h2 class="step-title">Step 1: PARTS OF a COCONUT FRUIT:</h2><div class="mediaset"><div class="photoset"><a href="https://content.instructables.com/F3D/3XBQ/LDEJCORY/F3D3XBQLDEJCORY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;fit=bounds&amp;width=1200&amp;height=900&amp;quality=85" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="PARTS OF a COCONUT FRUIT:" loading="lazy" src="https://content.instructables.com/F3D/3XBQ/LDEJCORY/F3D3XBQLDEJCORY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;fit=bounds&amp;frame=1auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;height=300&amp;auto=webp&amp;fit=bounds&amp;width=600&amp;height=450&amp;quality=75"/></a></div></div><noscript><div class="no-js-photoset"><a href="https://content.instructables.com/F3D/3XBQ/LDEJCORY/F3D3XBQLDEJCORY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;fit=bounds&amp;width=1200&amp;height=900&amp;quality=85" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="PARTS OF a COCONUT FRUIT:" loading="lazy" src="https://content.instructables.com/F3D/3XBQ/LDEJCORY/F3D3XBQLDEJCORY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;fit=bounds&amp;frame=1auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;height=300&amp;auto=webp&amp;fit=bounds&amp;width=600&amp;height=450&amp;quality=75"/></a></div></noscript><div class="step-body">

        1. It is nonpollutant.<br/><br/>Since the bowl is an organic matter, it has the ability to decompose and become a soil fertilizer when it is disposed. It is less likely to cause pollution to our environment. <br/><br/>2. It saves us money.<br/><br/>Most people would spend a considerable amount of money for their materials during important events, while people residing in the mountains save money by utilizing nature's help. It only takes a little effort to turn organic materials into useful instruments.<br/><br/>3. It is reusable.<br/><br/>The coconut bowl is not for a one-time use only but it can be washed, stored, and preserved to be utilized again in the future.
